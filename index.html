        <h1>How To Attract People..,</h1>
        <p> Good looks, ambition, and a good sense of humor are common qualities that people seek out.
          But there are other factors you're likely unaware of that play an important part in who you're attracted to.
          Past experiences, proximity, and biology all have a role in determining who catches our attention and who doesn't.</p>

        <h3>Amazing Person </h3>
          <p>Be that Person! If you want to attract other amazing people to you, then be that person too.
            Be what you want. We are often drawn to those who are like-minded. If you want amazing people in your life,
            be an amazing person! It sounds so simple and basic, but it is so true. Be the person that builds people up
            not the one who tries and tears people down. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <h3>Speak It! The power of positive affirmations. ...</h3>
        <p>The line between failure and success can come down to something as simple as self-talk.
          Powerful and positive self-talk can change your entire mindset, which can affect your actions.
          That, in turn, can have a massive impact on how successful you are on any journey you take or any
          obstacle you face.

          What we tell ourselves, whether fact or fiction, reflects how we see ourselves in the world. In a 2013 study,
           scientists studied anorexic women as they walked through their labs — believe it or not, these ladies turned
            their bodies sideways upon entering doorways, as if they were overweight and couldn’t fit through the door.
             Imagine that! This is because the way we view ourselves — and the nature of our self-talk — can shape the
             entire physiology of perspective.</p>

      <div class="third">
        <h3>Make the Connection! Get good at being genuinely interested in others. ...</h3>
        <p>One of the best book I have ever read “How to Win Friends & Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. One of the key
          principles that I have learned in the book is : “become genuinely interested in other people.”This book has really
           changed the level of my discussion.I realized that how we can change our chit chat into a search program about
           others ultimately it helps us in our personal and professional life as well.

           One of the primary skills he talks about in communication skills / people skills to make friends and improve
           social lives, he talks about becoming genuinely interested in other people. And from my experience in both business
           and personal life, I have found this extremely helpful and fruitful as well.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="fourth">
        <h3> Add Value! ...</h3>
        <p>The common theme here is that these people started off by giving something for nothing. They gave, gave and gave with no reward in sight. Over time their efforts compounded and paid off and people took notice of the value that they provided to the community.

At the end of the day, they were rewarded for their efforts. It would have most likely been a challenging and difficult road for them when they started off, just like you and me. But their tenacity and vision compounded with their relentless pursuit made all the difference.

Some may say these are not regular people, they are people that are super driven and motivated. And you may be right, they do have attributes that set them apart from the average person, but they started just like you and me, they started out the same, working a job, answering to a boss and living a regular life. However, they choose to be different, they choose to add value to others and make a difference.

For most people, it's easier to seek a comfortable life, to have an easy life, to not put in the extra effort. After all, why do the extra mile at work, or serve the community when there is nothing in it for you, no one wants to do that? Hence, most people choose the comfortable road, even if it means settling for less.</p>

      <div class="fifth">
        <h3>Lastly, Communicate your Vision!</h3>
        <p>Communicating vision effectively is a key leadership quality and crucial during periods of change. Keep the message simple by telling stories to demonstrate benefits, remaining authentic and approachable and helping employees to come to their own understanding which is consistent with the organisation’s vision of the future. By doing this organisations will better engage employees and motivate them to become an integral piece of the change coalition.</p>
